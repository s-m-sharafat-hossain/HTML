    <!--Span is a grouping of inline elements. It is used to apply styles or scripts to a specific portion of text or content without affecting the surrounding elements.
    
    Purpose: To apply styles or scripts to a specific portion of text or content without affecting the surrounding elements.
    
    Accessibility: It is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies to identify inline sections.
    
    Location: It can be used anywhere in the document, typically within a <p> or <span> element.
    
    Multiple Spans: A document can have multiple <span> elements, each representing a different section of inline content.
    
    Attributes: It can have attributes like id, class, style, etc., to apply specific styles or behaviors.

    Styling: Spans can be styled using CSS to control their appearance, such as background color, padding, and margins.
    Size: Spans can be resized using CSS properties like font-size and line-height.

    Non-semantic: Unlike block elements, spans do not create a new line before or after them, making them suitable for inline content.

    <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">This is a span element with blue text and bold font.</span>
    -->
    <p>
        <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">This is a span element with blue text and bold font.</span>
        This text is in a paragraph, and the span element is used to style a specific part of it.
