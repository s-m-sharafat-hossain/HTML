    <!-- The Name and Value attributes are used to identify form elements and their corresponding data when the form is submitted.
    
    Purpose: They allow the server to recognize which data corresponds to which form element, enabling proper processing of the submitted data.
    
    Location: The name attribute is placed within the form element, while the value attribute is typically associated with input elements.
    
    Attributes: The name attribute is essential for identifying form data, while the value attribute holds the actual data submitted by the user.
    
    Default Value: If not specified, the name attribute defaults to an empty string, and the value attribute defaults to the input's current value.
    
    Server-side Processing: When a form is submitted, the server uses these attributes to process and store the data accordingly.
    PHP, Python, and Java utilize these attributes to handle incoming form data effectively.
