    <!-- <main> tag is a semantic element. It is used for the main content of the document.
    
    Purpose: Used to contain the primary content of the document, excluding headers, footers, and sidebars.
    
    Semantic: It helps search engines and other user agents understand the main content of the page.

    Unique Element: The <main> element should be unique within a document, meaning there should only be one <main> element per page.

    Accessibility: The <main> element is important for accessibility, as it provides a semantic grouping for the main content of the page.

    Not for Sidebars or Footers: The <main> element should not be used for sidebars, footers, or other secondary content.
    
    Location: It is typically used once per page, but can be used multiple times in a document if needed.
    
    Multiple Main Sections: A document should ideally have only one <main> element, but it can be used in different sections if necessary.
    
    Example:
    <main>
        <h1>Main Content</h1>
        <p>This is the main content of the page.</p>
    </main>
     -->
    <header>Header</header>
    <main>
        <h1>Main Content</h1>
        <p>This is the main content of the page.</p>
    </main>
