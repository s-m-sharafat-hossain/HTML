    <!-- The <td> tag is used to create a cell in a table.

    Purpose: It is used to define a standard data cell in a table, containing data that is usually aligned to the left and not bold.

    Semantic: Helps search engines and other user agents understand the structure and content of the table.

    Location: It can be used anywhere within a <tr> tag to represent a cell in a table row.

    Multiple Data Cells: A table row can have multiple <td> elements, each representing a different piece of data.

    Nesting: <td> elements can contain other HTML elements like text, images, or links.

    Styling: The appearance of the cell can be customized using CSS, such as changing the text alignment or background color.

    Example:
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Data 1</td>
            <td>Data 2</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    -->
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Header 1</th>
            <th>Header 2</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Data 1</td>
            <td>Data 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Data 3</td>
            <td>Data 4</td>
        </tr>

    </table>
    <br>
    <table border="2">
        <tr>
            <td>Data 1</td>
            <td>Data 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Data 3</td>
            <td>Data 4</td>
        </tr>
